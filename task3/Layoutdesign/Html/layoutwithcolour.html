                                language. The classical method of learning English is to first learn the alphabets
                                used in the language, then learn to combine these alphabets to form words, which
                                in turn are combined to form sentences and sentences are combined to form
                                paragraphs. Learning C is similar and easier. Instead of straight-away learning how
                                to write programs, we must first know what alphabets, numbers and special
                                symbols are used in C, then how using them constants, variables and keywords are
                                constructed, and finally how are these combined to form an instruction. A group
                                of instructions would be combined later on to form a program. So </p>
